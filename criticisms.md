### [Deutsch limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch_limit)
> The problem with visual programming is that you canâ€™t have more than 50 visual primitives on the screen at the same time.

### Abstraction
* It is argued that there aren't many well-explored patterns for abstraction, aside from simply collapsing sections of visual code (akin to subroutines at worst or named functions at best).

### Mousing is Slow
* Typing text subjectively feels faster, perhaps since it's composed of smaller atomic actions.

### Spaghetti
* Crossing lines in node-and-wire languages looks messy, feels messy.

### Scaling
* The most common complaint from people _who have actually tried visual programming_ is that it works well in the small, but becomes untenable past a certain complexity threshold.
