* Talk: [Inventing on Principle](http://worrydream.com/InventingOnPrinciple)
    * The talk that launched a thousand research careers.
* Talk: [Drawing Dynamic Visualizations](https://vimeo.com/66085662)
    * Shares an idea for a direct-manipulation programming environment.
    * [Additional notes](http://worrydream.com/DrawingDynamicVisualizationsTalkAddendum/)
* Talk: [Stop Drawing Dead Fish](https://vimeo.com/64895205)
    * A talk by [Bret Victor]() in which he demonstrates a prototype iPad app for interactively building animations, with an experience more akin to puppet theatre than traditional keyframe-and-curves computer animation.
    * The app allows building algebraic relationships using geometric equivalents, a la Tristan Needham's book [Visual Complex Analysis](http://usf.usfca.edu/vca/) or the [GeoGebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoGebra) project. This is at odds with most computer animation tools, where dynamic relationships between visual elements are expressed using algebraic equations of the elements' numeric attributes.
* Article: [Learnable Programming](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/)
    * Not only is this a fantastic critique of augmented text-based programming tools, it's also sneaks in some fantastic critiques of visual programming languages too.
    > Traditional visual environments visualize the code. They visualize static structure. But that's not what we need to understand. We need to understand what the code is doing. Visualize data, not code. Dynamic behavior, not static structure.
* I could continue linking to dozens of things on [Bret's site](http://worrydream.com). The next time I read through them, I might link to some more and add my reflections. In the mean time, it should suffice to say that pretty much everything on his website is revelatory, inspirational, worthy of mass movements being forming around, and essential. His work defined the current cultural moment in programming tools, HCI, visual languages, and other computing frontiers of interest to readers of this codex.

* Talk: [Whoa, pictures! A visual history of visual programming languages!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU1aPvvQbqk)
    * Quickly surveys some of history's more interesting VPLs, with fun commentary and a nod the handful of studied benefits and downsides.
    * [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/eanakashima/whoa-pictures-a-visual-history-of-visual-programming-languages-con-2018) and [references](https://gist.github.com/eanakashima/7d2d06811dfb9e00836428a9a55abf33)

* [Illiterate Programming](https://gbracha.github.io/illiterateProgramming/out/illiterateProgramming.html)
    * A blog post about literate programming that turns into a demo of the Ampleforth live-coding environment for [Newspeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak_(programming_language)). Hint: the browser back button can be used to navigate "back" when interacting with the embedded Ampleforth editors.
    * "The ability to change the code of the system you are using while using it is a key property that is lacking in most systems."
    * Not directly about VPLs, but relevant due to the importance of live coding to most VPLs, and the mutual influence of Smalltalk.
    * "It's a self-eating-dog-eat-self-eating dog world"
    * Don't confuse the HopscotchIDE used by Ampleforth with the Scratch-like VPL named [Hopscotch](implementations.md#hopscotch).

* Paper: [Aesthetic Programming](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2517392_Aesthetic_Programming)
    * A fantastic paper about the synthesis of artistic aesthetics, modelling, and systems.
    * "By marrying traditional methods for computer programming with an artistic temperament, we give birth to a new phenomenon: the aesthetic program. Our work builds on visual approaches in programming as well as modeling for software, where I envision a gradual evolution from program to model. The need for the aesthetic model is strengthened with the importance of personalized, individually-tailored, models. I, and my students, have formulated the rube Project methodology around the use of 3D web-based virtual world construction of models. Initial results suggest that these models are artistic, while containing sufficient symbolism and concise metaphoric mapping as to be executable on a computer."

## Wikipedia


### ★ [Visual programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language)
* Includes a great list of VPLs.

### [Category: Visual programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Visual_programming_languages)
* Lists all the Wikipedia articles in the VPL category.

### [Deutsch limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch_limit)
* The problem with visual programming is that you can’t have more than 50 visual primitives on the screen at the same time.

### [Flow-based programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming)

### [List of programming languages by type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_type)
* I recommend searching for languages you're interested in, seeing what sections they appear within, then looking at other languages in those sections.
