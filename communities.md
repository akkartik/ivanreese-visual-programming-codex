## [Esolangs](http://esolangs.org)
This wiki of esoteric programming languages might be of interest to people looking for ideas _way_ outside the mainstream. My favourite categories:

* [Category: 2d-languages](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Category:Two-dimensional_languages)
* [Category: Multi-dimensional languages](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Category:Multi-dimensional_languages)
* [Category: Non-textual](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Category:Non-textual)
* [Category: Particle automata](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Category:Particle_automata)
* [List of Ideas: Game](http://esolangs.org/wiki/List_of_ideas#Game)
* [List of Ideas: Graphical input and/or output](https://esolangs.org/wiki/List_of_ideas#Graphical_input_and.2For_output)
* [List of Ideas: Music](https://esolangs.org/wiki/List_of_ideas#Music)


### [Future of Coding](https://futureofcoding.org)
* A Slack community and podcast hosted by [Steve Krouse](https://twitter.com/stevekrouse) and haunted by [yours truly](https://twitter.com/spiralganglion), with frequent and thriving discussions of visual programming, novel editors & languages, and the half-forgotten history of our field.


### [Glance â€” Related Work](https://github.com/rgleichman/glance/wiki/Related-work)
* Includes other visual Haskells, other functional VPLs, editors, and assorted papers/resources.


### [Gradual Typing Bibliography](http://samth.github.io/gradual-typing-bib/)
> This bibliography attempts to cover all of the literature on gradual typing, defined as safe interoperability between typed and untyped portions of a single program. It begins with the original work on gradual typing, which was independently presented by four sets of authors in between September 2006 and January 2007, and then covers the extensive subsequent literature, both theoretical and practical.


### [Mind Bicycles](https://github.com/pel-daniel/mind-bicyles)
* A meta-collection of projects, videos, and other assorted links


### [r/nosyntax](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosyntax)
* A reddit community interested in non-textual languages and tools.
> Most of computer programming in the history of mankind has been done by editing text files. Does it have to be this way? Will it always be this way? Some think that the current state of things is suboptimal and are exploring new frontiers in how code is made.
* They have a good list of [projects](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosyntax/wiki/projects).


### [Notation and Thought](https://github.com/hypotext/notation)
* A fantastic collection of links assembled by [Katherine Ye](https://twitter.com/hypotext)
> This syllabus examines the design of notation. We concern ourselves chiefly with one question: how does working in a particular notational system influence the ways that people think and create in it?


### [SomethingNew](https://github.com/d-cook/SomethingNew)
* A community discussing frontiers in software
> The best (and perhaps only) way for this to happen is to share openly and explore multiple possibilities (Alan Kay: "Stand on the shoulders of giants"). This project will thus primarily serve as a place to collaborate between multiple separate projects/efforts, with the goal of listing all related concepts & goals in one common place to maximize the exploration of ideas (and goals to aim for).
