> Befunge is a stack-based, reflective, esoteric programming language. It differs from conventional languages in that programs are arranged on a two-dimensional grid.

This [blog post](https://dorianbrown.dev/befunge/) by Dorian Brown does a fantastic job of visualizing the execution of Befunge, and includes an interactive playground.

![](assets/blender.jpg)

# [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
Blender is an open-source 3D animation program with several visual programming tools.

<br>

![](assets/blender-node-editor.png)

The [node editor](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/node_editor/introduction.html) allows you to create materials (shaders), texture maps, and compositing flows. They're also used for [rendering](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/cycles/nodes/introduction.html).

<br>

![](assets/blender-logic-editor.png)

The [logic editor](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/logic_editor.html) is used to set up game logic for Blender's built-in game engine. The interface seems like a slightly different take on patching, with a 3-step `sensor > controller > actuator` layout.

# [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/)
by Neil Fraser with Quynh Neutron, [Ellen Spertus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Spertus), and Mark Friedman at Google.

A JavaScript library for building Scratch-like block-based visual programming editors. Block code can be transpiled into JavaScript, Python, PHP, Dart, or other languages. An outgrowth of the [App Inventor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Inventor_for_Android) project.

> A New Visual Programming Environment to Build JavaScript By Linking Blocks.

Not particularly interesting on its own, but [Cochain](https://github.com/mimorisuzuko/chain/tree/feature/co) is cute.

    When I first read the word "coedit" I thought they meant the [dual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_(category_theory)) of "edit" and got *very* excited, wondering what that could mean. Alas. Exercise for the reader! (Let me know what you come up with)

Inspired by [Bret Victor's Drawing Dynamic Visualizations](reflections.md#bret-victor). The developer made a rough prototype (unreleased) and a concept video (shown on the website), but then wasn't able to continue working any further on this project, sadly. They suggested to me that they believe [Luna](#luna) to be more promising direction because it's more generic and not restricted to the domain of interactive animations.

# Duangle Prototypes: Noodles, Conspire

Prototypes created by Leonard Ritter of Duangle for their game Nowhere.

Blog post: [Conspire: A Programming Environment for NOWHERE](http://blog.duangle.com/2015/01/conspire-programming-environment-for.html)

Noodles includes a "compact" feature, which wraps selected node boxes into a new node, preserving connections.

Conspire is a Lisp-like (so non-visual, but...), designed to be extended in terms of itself: "And then it hit me: what if the editor was built from the grounds up with Lispy principles: the simplest graphically based visualization possible, extensible from within the editor, so that the editor would factually become an editor-editor"

# [Pure Data](https://puredata.info)

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data)

An open source VPL for musicians and artists. Pure Data (Pd) is the prototypical example of a VPL — boxes that direct or transform flowing data, connected together with lines through which the data flows. Pd has distinctly-styled lines for messages (strings) and for signals (audio data), and type-specific "objects" (boxes) like `sin` for messages and `sin~` for signals.

The help and tutorial documents are implemented as Pd patches, and you are encouraged to edit them.
